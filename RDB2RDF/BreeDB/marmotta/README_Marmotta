After installing Marmotta:
The default database is set to h2.

IF MySQL needs to be connected. Copy the JDBC connector from MySQL (Oracle Site)to 

/"installation directory"/marmotta/apache-tomcat-7.0.53/webapps/marmotta/WEB-INF/lib/mysql-connector-java-5.1.36-bin.jar

## Sesame is the API associated with KiWi Triple Store of Apache Marmotta.

It has support for languages:
Java
PHP
Python
R (http://opencube-toolkit.eu/r-statistical-analysis-module/)

# OpenCube toolkit also supports R2RML mapping database

1. Programmatic interface can be made in Sesame (rdf4j.org<http://rdf4j.org><http://rdf4j.org><http://rdf4j.org/>). It is a Java API to do this.
2. It is a bit heavy weight as it relies on Tomcat webserver.
3. There is no support for R2RML.
4. As in all other platforms some bugs exists.
5. Web statistics (As per Luiz slides during our ODEX meeting) does not exist.
